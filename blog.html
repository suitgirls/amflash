    <h2>Who is Genevieve Grotjan?</h2>
    <p>By: Audrey Flash - July 23th, 2024</p>
    <p>Genevieve Grotjan attended the University of Buffalo in 1936 with a degree in mathematics and began her career as a statistician. During WWII, her and her small US Army Signal Intelligence Service team was assigned the task to unravel the Japanese cipher known as Purple. She was able to identify a pattern in the cipher that provided the US military with the most important information regarding Japan’s strategies for the war. </p>
    <p>She was a part of the ‘code girls’ that aided in decrypting many other ciphers, including the cipher that were added to Enigma after the British broke the original, and broke codes that were used to set up Midway as a trap that turned the tide of the war in the favor of America. </p>
    <p>Despite her contributions, Grotjan’s achievements were unrecognized during her lifetime. It wasn’t until after her death when her work was resurfaced. Today, she is now a known figure in the field of cryptography and an inspiration for women in male dominated fields.</p>
