    <h1>Audrey Flash's Biography</h1>
    <p>I am a rising senior and I'm from Sammamish, Washington</p>
    <p>I have some coding experience, and interested in STEM, so this program seemed like a perfect blend.</p>
    <p>I am mainly interested in technology, but I want to learn more about engineering and the more hands on experience.</p>
    <p>At the age of 5, Audrey Flash was introduced to her <strong>very first dance class,</strong> a tap and ballet class. Ever since then, dance has been a vital part in Audrey's life where she continues to dance at the age of 17. She has placed overall both regional and nationally, and choreographs during the summer.</p>
    <p>Audrey has expressed interest in coding ever since the age of 7, where she attended coding for kids and used scratch to make fun games. After taking a few years away from coding, she has expressed more interest in the subject, and is attending IT Girls Pre-college program hosted by Syracuse University. </p>
