<body>
    At the age of 5, Audrey Flash was introduced to her very first dance class, a tap and ballet class. Ever since then, dance has been a vital part in Audrey's life where she continues to dance at the age of 17. She has placed overall both regional and nationally, and choreographs during the summer.
    She works part-time at a popular boba tea chain, Sharetea, where she enjoys working with her friends and getting free boba tea. 
    Audrey has expressed interest in coding ever since the age of 7, where she attended coding for kids and used scratch to make fun games. After taking a few years away from coding, she has expressed more interest in the subject, and is attending IT Girls Pre-college program hosted by Syracuse University.
